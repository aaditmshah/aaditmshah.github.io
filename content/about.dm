  \paragraph{Hello, my name is Aadit M Shah. I am an open-source developer from \link{Mumbai}~href{https://wikitravel.org/en/Mumbai}, \link{India}~href{https://wikitravel.org/en/India}. You might have come across my answers on \link{Stack Overflow}~href{https://stackoverflow.com/u/783743}. I have been answering questions on Stack Overflow since 2011, and I'm in the \link{top 0.26%}~href{https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/alltime/stackoverflow/2008-07-31/783743\#783743} of Stack Overflow users overall. I mostly answer questions related to \link{JavaScript}~href{https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A783743+%5Bjavascript%5D}, \link{functional programming}~href{https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A783743+%5Bfunctional-programming%5D}, and \link{Haskell}~href{https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A783743+%5Bhaskell%5D}.}
  \paragraph{I graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Science degree from \link{Indiana University Bloomington}~href{https://www.indiana.edu/} in May 2017. My specialization was programming languages, type systems, and compilers. I returned to India in 2019, and worked at \link{Hotstar}~href{https://www.hotstar.com/} as a front-end software developer for three years. Thus, I have both academic and industry experience.}
  \paragraph{During my career, I worked with \link{TypeScript}~href{https://www.typescriptlang.org/}, \link{React}~href{https://reactjs.org/}, \link{Next.js}~href{https://nextjs.org/}, and \link{Protocol Buffers}~href{https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers}. However, I felt that all these tools left a lot to be desired. For example, TypeScript is \link{unsound}~href{https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html}, React is \link{fauxtional}~href{https://youtu.be/HyWYpM_S-2c}, and Protocol Buffers are \link{wrong}~href{https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html}. Coming from an academic background, I have a lot of ideas on how to build better tools for the community. Hence, in July 2022 I decided to quit my job and work as a full-time open-source developer.}
