# About

Hello, my name is Aadit M Shah. I am an open-source developer from [Mumbai](https://wikitravel.org/en/Mumbai), [India](https://wikitravel.org/en/India). You might have come across my answers on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/u/783743). I have been answering questions on Stack Overflow since 2011, and I'm in the [top 0.26%](https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/alltime/stackoverflow/2008-07-31/783743#783743) of Stack Overflow users overall. I mostly answer questions related to [JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A783743+%5Bjavascript%5D), [functional programming](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A783743+%5Bfunctional-programming%5D), and [Haskell](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A783743+%5Bhaskell%5D).

I graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Science degree from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) in May 2017. My specialization was programming languages, type systems, and compilers. I returned to India in 2019, and worked at [Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com/) as a front-end software developer for three years. Thus, I have both academic and industry experience.

During my career, I worked with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers). However, I felt that all these tools left a lot to be desired. For example, TypeScript is [unsound](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html), React is [fauxtional](https://youtu.be/HyWYpM_S-2c), and Protocol Buffers are [wrong](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html). Coming from an academic background, I have a lot of ideas on how to build better tools for the community. Hence, in July 2022 I decided to quit my job and work as a full-time open-source developer.
